#WAP to find the factorial of first n numbers.(using for)
#Ans:

# n = 5
# fact = 1
# i = 1                       
# while i <= n:             #3While loop diye code
#     fact *= i 
#     i += 1   

# print("factorial =", fact)

#or

n = 5
fact = 1
                      
for i in range(1, n+1):                ## For loop diye code
    fact *= i 
    i += 1   

print("factorial = ",fact)
